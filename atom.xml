    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I came across an article touching on the impact of being too involved into a profession. Through my observation, I found out that my profession (programmer) has a major negative impact. I called it Programmers’ Negativity. Programmers’ Negativity (PN) is commonly found on a person after too many years engaging on coding, debugging or going through multiple SDLCs. A programmer has a habit to find bug and debug it. Everyday, we need to crush bug for our program to work flawlessly. When times flew by, unknowingly it has become part of a habit of programmer life. Programmers comment on everything. They see the negative side of everything. Criticise, criticise and criticise. Maybe this is part of the problem where majorly software developers hop so much in their career. Satisfaction is hard to comeby. </p>

<p>Yes I admit, I am infected by this disease. I must avoid it. Resisstt! </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have slowed down my updates on my blog these months. Lately, I spend my time travelling so do my works. The other reason behind the reduced of new posts because I am considering alternative platform to Posterous. Some of you might know that Posterous is winding down after the acquisition by Twitter. After several trials, I’ve decided to settle with Octopress hosted with Heroku due to several reasons:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete mirror of local copy</li>
  <li>Changes are tracked with Git</li>
  <li>Markdown</li>
  <li>Code snippet with Pygments (find some of them at <a href="http://shernshiou.github.com/blog/categories/code/">Code Categories</a>)</li>
  <li>Awesome mobile theme</li>
</ol>

<p>But this platform has several downside compared to Posterous</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lack of other ways of posting (e.g. email, mobile)</li>
  <li>Hard to embed without writing some changes</li>
  <li>I’m not familiar with Ruby</li>
  <li>Size matters at Heroku (for free hosting)</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m at about 80% of the total progress because I am still finding ways to include more images (by including other hosting) and porting embedded IFrame. One custom changes I’ve made on this blog is the ability to display LaTeX Math Equation with Kramdown (thanks to <a href="http://greglus.com/blog/2011/11/29/integrate-MathJax-LaTeX-and-MathML-Markup-in-Octopress/">Greglus</a>). </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From past few weeks till now, everyday moves fast. Been through ups and downs. Most of the time, it was stressful. For the first time, coding felt like an operation. When I was looking at the IDE, my surrounding resembles an operation room like the one in Grey’s Anatomy. My teammates left and right were like the other doctors giving me advices here and there. While I am the one holding my mouse like scalpel and executing the surgery by typing on my keyboard. This time I am flying solo. My mission now is to replace the old organ with the new and improved organ. The operation was hard. It went bitter when decommissioning the old component went hay-wire. Some tightly coupled segments misbehaved when I tried to pull out the old component. In order for the new component to work well, I need to fix the other parts as well. Sometimes when I was fixing other parts, I encountered tumour that was preventing the new component to slot in. The tumour therefore need to be removed. My nightmare came when my patient when into coma due to code haemorrhage. The memory keep bleeding, I need to open out the body and detect the wound. I hope everything will be fine. The operation is still undergoing but it is almost completed. I just wish my patient will wake up tomorrow, living the life like a normal person with an improved organ. </p>

    <id>http://shernshiou.github.com/blog/2012/05/08/population-growth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Human must be the favourite creation from the Nature. We are not only blessed with the power to think and comprehend but also very much suitable for the current situation. Human population grows tremendously in recent centuries especially after World War II (refer to  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth</a>). Referring to the graph <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=-304588800000&amp;tend=1304784000000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;q=world+data+population">here</a>, our population actually doubled from 1960s until now.</p>

<p>Once people thought we might experienced serious food crisis that will prevent the human to expand further however with the technology, we are able to produce food better for most of the people here (2 out of 7 billion people here still experiencing food security). </p>

<p>Can we keep populating the world more if we keep living longer, consuming the food and energy? There are signs we might hit the limit soon. With the growing competitiveness, some developed countries are experiencing lower birth rate. </p>

<p>I think we human are the greedy bunch. The mother earth has loved us so much, why are we keep taxing her? One day, the power of nature will strike us. :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two days ago at Orlando, Florida, RIM has just announce their upcoming product along with the spanking new Blackberry 10 (BBX). I am biased as I am working with BBX lately, I found that this announcement welcoming. Not mentioning the latest mobile gadget gimmickry, I am more intrigued on the development on BBX natively. Up until now only iOS officially support app development natively using Objective-C. As for the other platform, Android support native development with NDK (but its awfully ugly when you need to integrate NDK with Java through JNDI). As for Windows Phone 7, you all the codes are running on .NET VM. </p>

<p>I think BBX might change the game here with its Native development package. With it, I see many advantages (let alone the speed native can provide) compared not only with Android and WP7 but also iOS.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Low learning gap with C++</li>
  <li>Great utility with Qt (Yes, BBX native is backed by Qt)</li>
  <li>Lots of supported opensource project like OpenAL</li>
  <li>With Cascades (and QML from Qt), UI is easier to code and pretty too!</li>
</ol>

<p>I cant wait to get my hand on of those device.</p>

    <id>http://shernshiou.github.com/blog/2012/04/18/life-updates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Little bit updates since my last post. I am learning a lot lately, knowledge wise and spiritual wise. 
I think its important for a person to take a look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow’s_hierarchy_of_needs</a>). It may or may not be applicable for each individual needs but I think every person have their own hierarchy of needs. Most importantly every needs are built entirely as an hierarchy where the lowest needs always Physiological. Each level of needs depends on their lower level of needs. If one’s fundamental needs cannot be achievable the top most needs collapse too. E.g. you cannot be successful at your work if you have trouble finding your food source and shelter (Physiological needs). On the other hand, life’s goal go hand in hand with your hierarchy of needs. In order to achieve higher goal, certain level of need need to be attain else the physical or mental properties of the person are not on par with the goal set. Take a look at your needs and set goal accordingly to achieve your needs and your future. </p>

<p>Recently I love a quote which I read from Siddhartha written by Herman Hesse. It says:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beautiful was this world, looking at it thus, without searching, thus simply, thus childlike. Beautiful were the moon and the stars, beautiful was the stream and the banks, the forest and the rocks, the goat and the gold-beetle, the flower and the butterfly. Beautiful and lovely it was, thus to walk through the world, thus childlike, thus awoken, thus open to what is near, thus without distrust. “ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes the world is that beautiful, keep moving in tiny steps :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often was asked how Malaysian are you when you do not believe at a religion as the first Malaysian Constitution stated ‘Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan’ which roughly translate to ‘Believe in the God’. As a person that cannot understand religion, I do not subscribe to any of them. However throughout the years, from an atheist, slowly I begin to realise there have to be something larger than what we (human) can comprehend. In our daily life, there are mysteries we encountered. The mysteries that we cannot perceive yet it just comes so naturally. Therefore, I realised I need to recogize this element of unknown, element that is watching us everyday and element that is larger than us. Recognizing this element make me curious, make me small and feel belongs.</p>

<p>For me, religion is a medium. It serves well in the past as a part and parcel of human civilization. It teaches us the values and some knowledge when we have no foundation to rationalize. There are those dark ages in human civilization where we are ready to evolve into a larger societies yet values is the barrier. The best method at that time to inculcate the values and knowledge is through religion. Religion uses the power of unknown and fear (God) to strike knowledge to our heart. It serves us well until education and scientific methods teach us how to reason. I believe they has replaced religion to teach us the values and knowledge we need in this era. Who knows one day, some technology might replaced education and scientific method that can bring human to a higher level. But certainly, some parts of religion has obsolete by scientific method. The other havles of religion including moral and values that religion bring us is replaced by education.</p>

<p>I strongly believe there is no connection between the God and religion. Religions describe the God, the fanatics tries to be the along with the God and the spiritual leaders often used the God. In the end, I believe the God as a larger set of this universe, the unknown and the space. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Human resource is an important role for a company. Their job includes scrutinizing a candidate, hiring an employee or making sure the employee works with the company for the company. An employee can be compared to an apple. It is infectious as the bad bit will go viral affecting the remaining chunk. On the other hand, an employee with good attitude motivates the rest of the colleagues and teammates. It is essential for a leader to not only perform technically but also the attitude that creates positive force field.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my secondary school, everyone in the school read a poem by Robert Frost called The Road Not Taken. It questions us to pick a path for your future. It teaches me on being responsible on the decisions. Its has been years after I first encountered this poem, this poem still does not fail to frequent me whenever I am making hard decisions. Dear Robert, did you really sigh when you took the road less taken? Just so you know, I do not think your sigh is a sign of regret. I guess its a human norm. In the end, human is just the greedy bunch. There is another thing I learnt so far. There is a greater power that is not up above but resides within yourself. When the moment comes, the moment that requires your decision, the answer will appear. It comes straight from your heart. No matter how much you wanna reject it, you just cant. Its instinct. Just follow your instinct, believe in yourself, be responsible, the world will be brighter.</p>

I was in Klang Valley but yet I didn’t join it. For me this march is even bigger than a march itself. Many would think it is a peaceful march for the better future for Malaysia. However, many people joined this rally with different purposes. Each have their own agenda to see them happen. I guess this rally may has strike in the middle how people from various corners want it.</p>

<h3 id="current-government">Current Government</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this event (even from the proposal stage), the incumbent made a lot grey statements luring the BERSIH committee for the event to happen in a shape they wanted it. From banning the event, granting a venue yet retract it in the last minute, they are trying to test the limit of the people. Provoking the anger yet limiting the traffic into the city center confuses the people (organizer and the participants), all leads to their main objective. The signs and actions clearly show that they are striking fear to the rakyat to show their power. You never know, they might had planted someone inside the crowds to provoke them into hostility. At the end the peace rally became a non peace rally. With the police force using tear gas and chemical-laced water, the government made the whole scenario looks like angry-mob vs the police. This strikes two birds with one stones cause it also angers the business people around that area (quoting fake lost amount of economic lost). On top of that, using the mass-media the government are now able to paint the images of the opposition to cause the confusion to the non-intellectual people outskirt. All in all, the current government wanted to show their power and causes more people to hate the opposition to prepare for the upcoming election.</p>

<h3 id="the-opposition">The Opposition</h3>
<p>Some of you might be surprised, why are those old leaders from the opposition came to the rally knowingly they are unable to walk that far and get caught later? They too have their purposes. They are wise people. Having serving as oppositions for numbers of years, they knew in and out of Malaysian political scene. They believed a rally would not change anything in the end. The EC will be as kotor as long as the current government stayed. So why they came? First, they are borrowing this event as a free media to tear off the face of the incumbent. They uses BERSIH to tell the world how dirty is the election committee, how undemocratic is Malaysia. Knowing the leaders of the current government would not join this event (cause they have announced BERSIH as an illegal rally), they joined it to show how close they are with the rakyat hoping to get more trusts and loves from us which in the future they might get more votes. While walking with the rally, they hoped they get caught ‘live’ in front of the eyes. By getting caught, they showed how heroic they are by joining the people who get caught. On the other hand, it also shows that how brutal and unjust is our police force (under the provision of our current government). So you think they believe in clean electoral? NO, they came so they win.</p>

<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>You guys are victims of the event of cat and rat. With or without BERSIH, do you realized that we are a victim of the dirty political scene between current government and the opposition? Joining the event and risking your life so that you can be a part of the change might be heroic. Therefore, this BERSIH 2.0 sighted more teenager than the previous rarely. Drawing blood from the nature of rebellious in the teenagers and social media, the organizers carefully crafted the whole package to suit them. What you did is risking yourself, made your parent worry and volunteer yourself as a tool for the both parties. As a tool in this event, I congratulate you guys because you have archived the effect intended for the both parties. As a cherry on top of the cake, you are recognized by the international bodies making them to focus on Malaysia for a day. Both the parties got they wanted but do you get the clean election you requested?</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The rally did not achieve the objective but only more economic lost (according to the news :P). To be BERSIH, we need to acknowledge the root cause. The root of our current situation is not how kotor is our EC or how bersih we wanted for our coming election. The root of all these are caused by how dirty are our politicians. BERSIH showed us how deep we had sank. We are so dirt cheap now. Both sides are using the rakyat to archive what they wanted. They do not only neglected our voice and right but also have the power to swing us however they wanted. At one side, they break and conquer us (PERKASA). On the other side, they played with our mind telling us how the current government is conducting the rasuah as if they did not. As a tool, the rebellions are blinded therefore they chose side. They forgot either place they stand, they still will land on a piece of shit or on a smelly dung. So why do you want BERSIH election but the political parties here came from the ass which are still KOTOR? Fix them first!</p>

<p>I wish I wish I can sit on a fence high enough to hold on a helping hand from the heaven sky.</p>
