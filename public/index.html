  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two days ago at Orlando, Florida, RIM has just announce their upcoming product along with the spanking new Blackberry 10 (BBX). I am biased as I am working with BBX lately, I found that this announcement welcoming. Not mentioning the latest mobile gadget gimmickry, I am more intrigued on the development on BBX natively. Up until now only iOS officially support app development natively using Objective-C. As for the other platform, Android support native development with NDK (but its awfully ugly when you need to integrate NDK with Java through JNDI). As for Windows Phone 7, you all the codes are running on .NET VM. </p>

<p>I think BBX might change the game here with its Native development package. With it, I see many advantages (let alone the speed native can provide) compared not only with Android and WP7 but also iOS.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Low learning gap with C++</li>
  <li>Great utility with Qt (Yes, BBX native is backed by Qt)</li>
  <li>Lots of supported opensource project like OpenAL</li>
  <li>With Cascades (and QML from Qt), UI is easier to code and pretty too!</li>
</ol>

<p>I cant wait to get my hand on of those device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Little bit updates since my last post. I am learning a lot lately, knowledge wise and spiritual wise. 
I think its important for a person to take a look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow’s_hierarchy_of_needs</a>). It may or may not be applicable for each individual needs but I think every person have their own hierarchy of needs. Most importantly every needs are built entirely as an hierarchy where the lowest needs always Physiological. Each level of needs depends on their lower level of needs. If one’s fundamental needs cannot be achievable the top most needs collapse too. E.g. you cannot be successful at your work if you have trouble finding your food source and shelter (Physiological needs). On the other hand, life’s goal go hand in hand with your hierarchy of needs. In order to achieve higher goal, certain level of need need to be attain else the physical or mental properties of the person are not on par with the goal set. Take a look at your needs and set goal accordingly to achieve your needs and your future. </p>

<p>Recently I love a quote which I read from Siddhartha written by Herman Hesse. It says:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beautiful was this world, looking at it thus, without searching, thus simply, thus childlike. Beautiful were the moon and the stars, beautiful was the stream and the banks, the forest and the rocks, the goat and the gold-beetle, the flower and the butterfly. Beautiful and lovely it was, thus to walk through the world, thus childlike, thus awoken, thus open to what is near, thus without distrust. “ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes the world is that beautiful, keep moving in tiny steps :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I often was asked how Malaysian are you when you do not believe at a religion as the first Malaysian Constitution stated ‘Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan’ which roughly translate to ‘Believe in the God’. As a person that cannot understand religion, I do not subscribe to any of them. However throughout the years, from an atheist, slowly I begin to realise there have to be something larger than what we (human) can comprehend. In our daily life, there are mysteries we encountered. The mysteries that we cannot perceive yet it just comes so naturally. Therefore, I realised I need to recogize this element of unknown, element that is watching us everyday and element that is larger than us. Recognizing this element make me curious, make me small and feel belongs.</p>

<p>For me, religion is a medium. It serves well in the past as a part and parcel of human civilization. It teaches us the values and some knowledge when we have no foundation to rationalize. There are those dark ages in human civilization where we are ready to evolve into a larger societies yet values is the barrier. The best method at that time to inculcate the values and knowledge is through religion. Religion uses the power of unknown and fear (God) to strike knowledge to our heart. It serves us well until education and scientific methods teach us how to reason. I believe they has replaced religion to teach us the values and knowledge we need in this era. Who knows one day, some technology might replaced education and scientific method that can bring human to a higher level. But certainly, some parts of religion has obsolete by scientific method. The other havles of religion including moral and values that religion bring us is replaced by education.</p>

<p>I strongly believe there is no connection between the God and religion. Religions describe the God, the fanatics tries to be the along with the God and the spiritual leaders often used the God. In the end, I believe the God as a larger set of this universe, the unknown and the space. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Human resource is an important role for a company. Their job includes scrutinizing a candidate, hiring an employee or making sure the employee works with the company for the company. An employee can be compared to an apple. It is infectious as the bad bit will go viral affecting the remaining chunk. On the other hand, an employee with good attitude motivates the rest of the colleagues and teammates. It is essential for a leader to not only perform technically but also the attitude that creates positive force field.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During my secondary school, everyone in the school read a poem by Robert Frost called The Road Not Taken. It questions us to pick a path for your future. It teaches me on being responsible on the decisions. Its has been years after I first encountered this poem, this poem still does not fail to frequent me whenever I am making hard decisions. Dear Robert, did you really sigh when you took the road less taken? Just so you know, I do not think your sigh is a sign of regret. I guess its a human norm. In the end, human is just the greedy bunch. There is another thing I learnt so far. There is a greater power that is not up above but resides within yourself. When the moment comes, the moment that requires your decision, the answer will appear. It comes straight from your heart. No matter how much you wanna reject it, you just cant. Its instinct. Just follow your instinct, believe in yourself, be responsible, the world will be brighter.</p>
