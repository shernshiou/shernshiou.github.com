After a month into my new job, I got my new life.  
Despite the jam, I woke up early to get to my office.  
I learned to code, debug.  
The best part of the day when you get to type commit into version control.  
Back home, I cook my own dinner.  
Attend online lecture after that or continue on my journal paper.  
Before I sleep, I read a few chapters.  
I got to do what I like every seconds.
