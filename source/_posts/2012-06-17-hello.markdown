Raining outside my window  
The sun is hiding behind the haze  
Hello sky, are you feeling better now?

Trees moving wildly at the garden  
Dancing or shaking only they know  
Hello trees, are you happy now?

Wind outside blowing sturdily  
Birds traveling under strong current  
Hello little animals, are you safe at home now?
